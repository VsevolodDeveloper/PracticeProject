# PracticeProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 4 by Vsevolod Khlebnikov.

Test project, the purpose of which was to implement certain principles of programming and show the ability to work with the Unreal engine and knowledge of an engine API.

The project is a souls-like game, in which the main character wakes up on an iced island and tries to get out of it. On the way he meets many enemies, who clearly don't like him and want to fight.
